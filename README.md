## üìëProject Overview

This challenge presented with us a csv which included the CryptoCurrency and its Price change percentages within 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days and 60 days. 

## üéØAim

In this challenge, we are challenged to use our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## üñ•Ô∏èData Source

Note that this dataset was created and generated by idX Boot Camps LLC and is intended for educatio purposes only. 

## Repository Summary 
- [`Resources Folder`](https://github.com/jflengkong/CryptoClustering/tree/main/Resources)
      - includes the [crypto_market_data.csv](https://github.com/jflengkong/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Resources/crypto_market_data.csv)
- [`Images`](https://github.com/jflengkong/CryptoClustering/tree/main/Images)
      - Screenshots of outputs and results
- [Crypto_Clustering Notebook](https://github.com/jflengkong/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.ipynb)
      - Main code for all data preparation and results of findings 

## üìäAnalysis Steps 

- **Part 1: Preparing the Data**
  
  Create a DataFrame with the scaled data
  
- **Part 2: Find Best Value for K - Original Scaled DataFrame:**

  Use the elbow method to find the best value for k
  
- **Part 3: Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means- Original Scaled DataFrame::**

  Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data
  
- **Part 4: Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

  Use the original scaled DataFrame and perform PCA and reduce the features to three principal components
  
- **Part 5: Find the Best Value k - PCA Data**

  Use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for k
  
- **Part 6: Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using the PCA Data**

  Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the PCA data.

## Part 1: Preparing the Data 
Create a DataFrame with the scaled data. 

Using the `StandardScaler()` to fit and transform the data, we were able to normalise the data from teh CSV file. A DataFrame was created with the original columns with the now normalised data.

## üìëConclusions

In summary, 

- the data points towards a positive trend in reducing overall state fatalities. Sustaining these improvements requires continuous monitoring.
- Recognizing state-specific variations and understanding road user patterns are critical elements for formulating targeted strategies aimed at improving road safety.
- Understanding the age distribution of fatalities is essential for tailoring interventions and policies to address the specific needs of different age groups, thereby contributing to overall road safety.
