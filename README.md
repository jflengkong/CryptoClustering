## 📑Project Overview

This challenge presented with us a csv which included the CryptoCurrency and its Price change percentages within 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days and 60 days. Note that this dataset was created and generated by idX Boot Camps LLC and is intended for educatio purposes only. 

## 🎯Aim

In this challenge, we are challenged to use our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## 🖥️Data Source

The analysis is based on the [Australian Road Deaths Database](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-5b530fb8-526e-4fbf-b0f6-aa24e84e4277/details?q=road%20fatalities%20in%20Australia), focusing on road fatalities and crash data. The dataset is available until September 2023.
The database used to derive the latitudes and longitudes is [The Latitudes and Longitudes](https://github.com/Elkfox/Australian-Postcode-Data/blob/master/au_postcodes.csv)

## 📊Analysis Focus

- **Preparing the Data** Create a DataFrame with the scaled data 
- **Find Best Value for K - Original Scaled DataFrame:** - Use the elbow method to find the best value for k  
- **Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means- Original Scaled DataFrame::** Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data
- **Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** Use the original scaled DataFrame and perform PCA and reduce the features to three principal components
- **Find the Best Value k - PCA Data** Use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for k
- **Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using the PCA Data** - Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the PCA data.







## 📑Conclusions

In summary, 

- the data points towards a positive trend in reducing overall state fatalities. Sustaining these improvements requires continuous monitoring.
- Recognizing state-specific variations and understanding road user patterns are critical elements for formulating targeted strategies aimed at improving road safety.
- Understanding the age distribution of fatalities is essential for tailoring interventions and policies to address the specific needs of different age groups, thereby contributing to overall road safety.
