## üìëProject Overview

This challenge presented with us a csv which included the CryptoCurrency and its Price change percentages within 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days and 60 days. 

## üéØAim

In this challenge, we are challenged to use our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## üñ•Ô∏èData Source

Note that this dataset was created and generated by idX Boot Camps LLC and is intended for education purposes only.

## Part 1: Preparing the Data 
<i> <b>Instructions:</b> Create a DataFrame with the scaled data. </i> 

Using the `StandardScaler()` to fit and transform the data, we were able to normalise the data from the CSV file. A DataFrame was created with the original columns with the now normalised data. 


<h3><b>Original</b></h3>

 <h3><b>Normalised</b></h3>

## Part 2: Find Best Value for K - Original Scaled DataFrame 
<i> <b>Instructions:</b> Use the elbow method to find the best value for k </i> 

By creating a list with the number of k-values ranging from 1 to 11, we were able to create a DataFrame for the elbow data for the original data and plot a line chart with all the inertia values to visualise the optimal value for k. 

![original_elbow](https://github.com/jflengkong/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Images/1.%20original_elbow.png) 

<b> Answer: The best value for `k = 4` </b>

---------------------------------

## Part 3: Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means- Original Scaled DataFrame 
<i><b>Instructions:</b> Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data </i> 

Using the scaled data and the best value of `k = 4`, we made a prediction on the model, copied the DataFrame and added a new column to categorise and predict the clusters. This was then plotted on a scatter plot for a visual.

---------------------------------


## Part 4: Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
<i> <b>Instructions:</b> Use the original scaled DataFrame and perform PCA and reduce the features to three principal components </i> 

To optimise the predictions, we allowed the machine to create a Principal Component Analysis. This was completed by creating a model instance set to `n_components =3`. The scaled data was then fit and transformed into the PCA.

<b> Note that there was 89.5% total explained variance of the three principal components </b>

## Part 5: Find the Best Value k - PCA Data
<i> <b>Instructions:</b> Use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for k</i> 

By creating a list with the number of k-values ranging from 1 to 11, we were able to create a DataFrame for the elbow data for the PCA data and plot a line chart with all the inertia values to visualise the optimal value for k using the PCA data. 

    
![pca_values](https://github.com/jflengkong/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Images/5.pca_elbow_values.png) 

<b> Answer: The best value for `k = 4` for the PCA Data. </b> <br> 
<i> Note that this did not differ from the original data prediction k-value but had differing inertia values. </i>

---------------------------------


## Part 6: Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using the PCA Data
<i> <b>Instructions:</b>Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the PCA data </i> 

Using the PCA data, we made a prediction on the model, copied the DataFrame and added a new column to categorise and predict the clusters. This was then plotted on a scatter plot for visualisation.

## Part 7: Visualise and Compare the Results 
<i><b> Instructions: </b>  
- Create a composite plot to compare the elbow curve that you created from the original data with the one that you created from the PCA data
- Create a composite plot to compare the cryptocurrency clusters that resulted from using the original data with those that resulted from the PCA data.</i>

By Using the HvPlot and the plus sign (+) operator we created composite plots. In addition, it was noted that for the elbow curve, using the asterisk (*) operator gave us a better visualisation of the difference between the original scaled data vs. the PCA data as below.

## üìëConclusions

</div> 

In summary, the following questions were answered: 

1. **What was the best value for k for the original data?**

    Best value for `k = 4`

2. **What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?**

    89.5% of the data is the total explained variance of the three principal components

3. **What is the best value for k when using the PCA data? Did this differ from the best k value found using the Original Data?**

    The best K value for `k = 4 ` when using the PCA Data. This did not differ from the k-value for the original data.
 
4. **After visually analysing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?**
  
    In the last composite plot we can see that using fewer features  results in a higher inertia value which indicates that these clusters are closer together and easier to visualise. This also give us a more accurate look at the data without all the noise,     which is outliers of the data.
